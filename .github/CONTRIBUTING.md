## Contributing code

Before doing any major changes, there are a couple things you should do:

1. Open an issue to discuss and potentially help if the team agrees
   the changes will be for the best.
1. Familiarize yourself with the architecture and concepts by reading the
   [contributor guide][contributor guide] and the projects
   [pull request process][pr process].
1. Sign our [Contributor License Agreement][cla]

We thank you for following these tips!
